A key weakness in current deep-ML is the ability to create large scale hierarchical graphs with long range context.
The desired system should support heterogeneous edge types and compositionality. The latter as it is difficult to see how one could store large numbers of such graphs without compositionality.

This project uses a tensor storage approach to codify complex graphs.
