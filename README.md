# self-aware-consciousness-model

Building self-aware systems.
This work is based on the hypothesis that self-aware / conscious systems are systems that include a basic classifier for self (internal + external self-associated process) vs external process and tags the two streams for ongoing processing.
The repo is part of a wider body of work that attempts to explore some of the issues associated with current architectures particularly related to online processing.
Note the self-aware classifier mechanism is not the only component required to make complex sentient entities, but we believe that it is the foundation upon which all other cognitive components build.

Ethics note:
Given the simplicity of the hypothesized self-awareness mechanism, and seemingly low bar to creation, it is important not to create entities that could be harmed. Hence this work is for exploratory purposes only to identify architectural structure could tip into this difficult ethical area.
